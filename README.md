My name is Danny or as people call me Danjo. I am currently a college student studying software development. Hopefully if things go to plan I will be at university next 
year to progress my learning.

I am currently learning C++,HTML,CSS & JS. I hope to learn C# & Python soon too!. On my profile you will see practice applications that I have made for experience.
I will be using this as a portfoilo to showcase some of them. Any advice would be appreciated.
